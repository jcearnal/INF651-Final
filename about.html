        <h1>About TaskManager</h1>
   
        <p>Welcome to TaskManager, a project developed as part of the INF 651 - Front End Development I course at Fort Hays State University. TaskManager is a web-based task management tool designed with the goal of applying front-end development skills in a practical setting.</p>
